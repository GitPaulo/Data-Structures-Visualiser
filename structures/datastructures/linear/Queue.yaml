Title: Queue (Circular Array)
Description: |- 
 A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
 The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 
 A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 
Operations:
 Insertion:
  Description: Using a head pointer a value is inserted.
  Complexity: O(1)
 Deletion:
  Description: Using a tail pointer a value is removed.
  Complexity: O(1)
 Search:
  Description: Searching a queue using only queue operations and one queue of space complexity - is essentially performing bubble sort in a circular fashion.
  Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
