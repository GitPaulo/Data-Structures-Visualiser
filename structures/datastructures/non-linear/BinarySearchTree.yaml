Title: Binary Search Tree
Description: |- 
 Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties
    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
